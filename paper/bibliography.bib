  abstract = "Antarctica's ice shelves help to control the flow of glacial ice
              as it drains into the ocean, meaning that the rate of global
              sea-level rise is subject to the structural integrity of these
              fragile, floating extensions of the ice sheet. Until now, data
              limitations have made it difficult to monitor the growth and
              retreat cycles of ice shelves on a large scale, and the full
              impact of recent calving-front changes on ice-shelf buttressing
              has not been understood. Here, by combining data from multiple
              optical and radar satellite sensors, we generate pan-Antarctic,
              spatially continuous coastlines at roughly annual resolution
              since 1997. We show that from 1997 to 2021, Antarctica
              experienced a net loss of 36,701 $\pm$ 1,465 square kilometres
              (1.9 per cent) of ice-shelf area that cannot be fully regained
              before the next series of major calving events, which are likely
              to occur in the next decade. Mass loss associated with ice-front
              retreat (5,874 $\pm$ 396 gigatonnes) has been approximately equal
              to mass change owing to ice-shelf thinning over the past quarter
              of a century (6,113 $\pm$ 452 gigatonnes), meaning that the total
              mass loss is nearly double that which could be measured by
              altimetry-based surveys alone. We model the impacts of
              Antarctica's recent coastline evolution in the absence of
              additional feedbacks, and find that calving and thinning have
              produced equivalent reductions in ice-shelf buttressing since
              2007, and that further retreat could produce increasingly
              significant sea-level rise in the future.",

               application for tracking ice displacement",
  author    = "Lei, Yang and Gardner, Alex and Agram, Piyush",
  abstract  = "In this paper, we build on past efforts with regard to the
               implementation of an efficient feature tracking algorithm for
               the mass processing of satellite images. This generic
               open-source feature tracking routine can be applied to any type
               of imagery to measure sub-pixel displacements between images.
               The routine consists of a feature tracking module (autoRIFT)
               that enhances computational efficiency and a geocoding module
               (Geogrid) that mitigates problems found in existing geocoding
               algorithms. When applied to satellite imagery, autoRIFT can run
               on a grid in the native image coordinates (such as radar or map)
               and, when used in conjunction with the Geogrid module, on a
               user-defined grid in geographic Cartesian coordinates such as
               Universal Transverse Mercator or Polar Stereographic. To
               validate the efficiency and accuracy of this approach, we
               demonstrate its use for tracking ice motion by using ESA's
               Sentinel-1A/B radar data (seven pairs) and NASA's Landsat-8
               optical data (seven pairs) collected over Greenland's Jakobshavn
               Isbr{\ae} glacier in 2017. Feature-tracked velocity errors are
               characterized over stable surfaces, where the best Sentinel-1A/B
               pair with a 6 day separation has errors in X/Y of 12 m/year or
               39 m/year, compared to 22 m/year or 31 m/year for Landsat-8 with
               a 16-day separation. Different error sources for radar and
               optical image pairs are investigated, where the seasonal
               variation and the error dependence on the temporal baseline are
               analyzed. Estimated velocities were compared with reference
               velocities derived from DLR's TanDEM-X SAR/InSAR data over the
               fast-moving glacier outlet, where Sentinel-1 results agree
               within 4\% compared to 3--7\% for Landsat-8. A comprehensive
               apples-to-apples comparison is made with regard to runtime and
               accuracy between multiple implementations of the proposed
               routine and the widely-used ``dense ampcor`` program from
               NASA/JPL's ISCE software. autoRIFT is shown to provide two
               orders of magnitude of runtime improvement with a 20\%
